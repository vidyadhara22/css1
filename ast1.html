    <h3><i id="asd">What is CSS?</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><s>Css is not necessary</s> <span class="yellow"><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><u> <i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i> </u></li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3><i id="asd">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways :</i></h3>
    <ul id="zxc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="yellow"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </b></span> because this is easier to demostrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selection are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selection available. Two of the most commonly used class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
